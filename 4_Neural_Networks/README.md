# Week 4: Neural Networks and Applications üß†

## Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks

This week, we're exploring the world of neural networks, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## What You'll Learn:

### Introduction to CNNs:

- Understand the basics of Convolutional Neural Networks.
- Learn how convolution operations and filters extract features from images.
- Explore the architecture of CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- Understand the role of activation functions and how they help in non-linearity.

### Introduction to RNNs:

- Learn the fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Networks.
- Understand how RNNs handle sequential data and the concept of memory in RNNs.
- Explore different types of RNNs, including Vanilla RNNs, LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units).
- Learn how RNNs retain information over time steps and manage dependencies in sequences.

## Hands-On Projects

### CNN for German Traffic Sign Dataset üö¶
We'll start by working on a project using the German Traffic Sign dataset. This project will guide you through:

- Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset, explore traffic sign images, and preprocess the data.
- Building a CNN: Construct a Convolutional Neural Network to classify different traffic signs.
- Training and Evaluation: Train your model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

### RNN for IMDB Movie Review üé•üçø
Next, we'll work on sentiment analysis with an RNN using the IMDB Movie Review dataset. This project includes:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and preprocess movie reviews, converting text data into a format suitable for RNNs.
- Building an RNN: Create a Recurrent Neural Network to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews.
- Training and Evaluation: Train your model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.
