# Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning 🚀

## Overview of Machine Learning 📚

What You'll Learn:
- **Basic Concepts**: Get a solid understanding of what machine learning is all about.
- **Types of ML Algorithms**: Discover the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
- **ML Pipeline**: Understand the end-to-end process of building and deploying a machine learning model.

## Python Essentials for ML 🐍
What You'll Learn:
- **[Essential Python Skills](https://github.com/evisp/Holberton_ML_Summer_School/blob/main/1_Intro_to_Machine_Learning/Python%20Crash%20Course.ipynb)**: Brush up on the Python programming skills you'll need for ML.
- **Libraries**: Get to know (for now, just an introduction) key Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`.

## Tools to Use 🛠️
What You'll Install:
- **Anaconda Distribution**: We'll use Anaconda for a smooth setup.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment to write and run Python code, part of Anaconda distribution

### Installation Steps:
- [**Download Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/download): Visit the Anaconda website and download the latest version for your operating system.
- **Install Anaconda**: Follow the installation instructions on the Anaconda website.
- **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook.

*Note: While Anaconda is our recommended setup for its ease of use, you are free to choose other environments such as PyCharm, VS Code, or any other Python IDE you're comfortable with.*

## Hands-on Activity 👨‍💻
What You'll Do:
- **Implement ML Algorithms**: We'll be working with logistic regression and decision tree algorithms.
- **Titanic Dataset**: Apply these algorithms to the Titanic dataset to [predict survival outcomes](https://github.com/evisp/Holberton_ML_Summer_School/blob/main/1_Intro_to_Machine_Learning/Practice%20Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals%20with%20the%20Titanic%20Dataset.ipynb).
