# 🚀 Holberton Machine Learning Summer School! 🤖

## Objectives 🎯

Our mission is to dive headfirst into the exciting world of AI and machine learning. Here’s what we aim to achieve:

🧠 Introduce participants to the essential principles and methodologies of machine learning.
🛠️ Offer hands-on learning experiences through interactive workshops and projects.

## Curricula and Timeline 📅
The fun begins on `Jun 11, 2024`, and we'll keep the excitement going (at least) until `Jul 9, 2024`.

🕙 Sessions are **every Tuesday**, from `10:00` am to `3:00` pm.
